# AudioModel
# ðŸŽ™ Speaker Recognition Model

This project implements a speaker recognition model that can identify and label different speakers in an audio file. It's useful for speaker diarization, transcription, and analyzing conversations involving multiple people.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects different speakers in an audio recording.
- Labels speech segments by speaker.
- Can be used for audio transcription pipelines.
- Built using [mention libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, pyannote-audio, etc.].

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Preprocess the input audio (convert to mono, resample, etc.).
2. Extract speaker embeddings.
3. Cluster speech segments based on similarity.
4. Output audio segments with speaker labels.

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
# Example usage (replace with your actual commands)
python predict.py --input path/to/audio.wav
